**Explanation:**
Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in Python and can be found in the `Solution1.py` file.

### Approach

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `dict1`.
2. Iterate through the list `nums`.
3. For each element, calculate the complement (`target - nums[i]`).
4. Check if the complement exists in the dictionary.
5. If it exists, return the indices of the complement and the current element.
6. If it does not exist, add the current element and its index to the dictionary.

### File Structure

- `Question1.txt`: Contains the problem statement.
- `Solution1.py`: Contains the Python implementation of the solution.

## Usage

To run the solution, execute the `Solution1.py` file:

```bash
python Solution1.py
```
The program will output the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
